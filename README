1. Fast Global File Status
   
     Large-scale systems typically mount many different file systems 
     with distinct performance characteristics and capacity. High 
     performance computing (HPC) applications must efficiently use 
     this storage in order to realize their full performance potential. 
     Users must take into account potential file replication throughout
     the storage hierarchy as well as contention in lower levels of the
     I/O system, and must consider communicating the results of file
     I/O between application processes to reduce file system accesses.
     Addressing these issues and optimizing file accesses requires
     detailed run-time knowledge of file system performance
     characteristics and the location(s) of files on them.

     We developed Fast Global File Status (FGFS) to provide a scalable
     mechanism to retrieve such information of a file, including its
     degree of distribution or replication and consistency. FGFS uses
     a novel node-local technique that turns expensive, non-scalable
     file system calls into simple string comparison operations.
     FGFS raises the namespace of a locally-defined file path to a
     global namespace with little or no file system calls to obtain
     global file properties efficiently. Our evaluation on a large
     multi-physics application showed that most FGFS file status queries
     on its executable and 848 shared library files complete in 272
     milliseconds or faster at 32,768 MPI processes. Even the most
     expensive operation, which checks global file consistency, completes
     in under 7 seconds at this scale, an improvement of several orders
     of magnitude over the traditional checksum technique.


2. Dependencies

   A. Mount Point Attributes module
    
     The main abstractions that enable raising the namespace of local
     file names are packaged up into the MountPointAttributes module.
     Because some tools wish to use this module by itself, we have 
     created its own repostory. 

     You can download the latest version of MountPointAttributes in 
     Github: http://dongahn.github.io/MountPointAttributes

   B. MRNet

     This package has been ported to both MPI and MRNet. To build the 
     complete package, you must have MRNet installed on your system. 

     You can download a version of MRNet in http://www.paradyn.org/mrnet

   C. OpenSSL

     Fast Global File Status allows its user to define a function that
     computes consistency between two physically different files. To 
     develop unit test cases for this functionality, we have used the
     MD5 function that comes w/ OpenSSL. Thus to build test cases, you 
     must have OpenSSL on your system. 


3. Compatibility

     Fast Global File Status v1.1
       - MountPointAttributes (v1.1)
       - MRNet (v3.1.0 and v4.0.0 w/ performance patch)
       - OpenSSL (v1.0.0)


4. Configuration 

     * Please follow README of MountPointAttributes (MPA) to configure, 
       build and install this dependent module.

     * Assuming MPA has been installed in <your_install_path> and also MPI
       is available through normal installations, the following command 
       should configure this package for both MPI and MRNet:

       % mkdir <platform> (e.g., RHEL6_x86_64_ib)
       % cd <platform>
       % ../configure --prefix=<your_install_path> \
                      --with-mrnet=<MRNet installation root> \
                      --with-max-dist-degree=intVal

       Note that --with-max-dist-degree=intVal sets the maximum number of 
       remote servers on which a file can be possibly distributed or duplicated. 
       This should be the site-wide worse case. When the file is served locally 
       via some local file systems such as RAMDISK, FGFS has ways to 
       determine this condition. So the maintainer must set this value with respect to
       the worst "remote-server" case (e.g., a set of NFS file servers serve
       a file to the processes), which is typically much smaller than the 
       the worse "local" case. For LLNL Linux clusters, we set this to 20, as 
       the worst case is when 1 NFS server per scalable unit (156 16-way 
       compute nodes) serve files to the processes.

       Note that if MPA is installed somewhere other than <your_install_path>, 
       you can use the optional --with-mpa=<mpa path>.
